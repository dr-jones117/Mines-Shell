# MISH (Mines Shell)

This program was created for my operating systems class at South Dakota School of Mines.
It's a shell that implements piping and parallel commands.

## How To Run 
After cloning the repo, cd into the root directory and run the following command:
`mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && cd bin`

You've just compiled the project and can now run the `mish` binary. Have fun!
